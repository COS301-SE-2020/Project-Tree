# Project Management Tree

<img src="group photo.jpg" width=300/>

The project entails the development of a project management system. The system represents a project visually as a tree structure, with each “leaf” being a project task, and each branch being a task dependency. The core idea of the system is to allow for all task dependencies to be captured accurately and clearly, to ensure effective project management.
